# Analysing dual-stream convolutional neural networks for action recognition using excitation backpropagation

## Setup
* Edit `lib/config.py` to point to your local [excitation bp caffe](https://github.com/jimmie33/Caffe-ExcitationBP) installation,
  nets path (e.g. `caffe/models`, I like to keep mine in my home directory), and data root.
